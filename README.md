## Latin-Spanish Language Learning Experience

I took inspiration from a variety of sources and approaches when developing the Que Padrísimo Latin-Spanish Language Learning website, with the goal of giving users an engaging and productive learning experience and environment. I used ideas from user-centred design and language learning methodologies to guide the development process, loosely inspired by, for example, "The Elements of User Experience" methodology.

## Project Development Approach

In attempt to provide a comprehensive and impactful educational platform, I divided the project's progress into the following stages:

- Discovery Phase
- Planning Phase
- Development Phase
- Testing Phase
- Deployment Phase

Each phase was thoroughly planned and executed step-by-step, in order to address different aspects of the platform's functionality, content, and user interaction. Using this approach allowed for a user-centric, holistic and iterative development process, with a focus on both the educational content and the user experience.

### Discovery Phase

#### My Goals:

- I aimed to streamline the user journey, ensuring smooth navigation across the platform.
- I endeavoured to enhance textual clarity to prevent any potential user confusion.
- My aspiration was to elicit positive emotional responses from users, fostering deeper engagement.
- I worked towards maintaining coherence and relevance across all elements of the content.
- Lastly, I focused on structuring the content in a way that avoids overwhelming users.

### User Objectives:

  #### Goals for First-time Visitors:

  - Swiftly grasp the purpose and scope of the platform.
  - Effortlessly navigate between games and pages.
  - Experience a sense of progression while exploring.
  - Minimise visual fatigue caused by excessive content.
  - Resume browsing seamlessly after any interruptions.

  #### Goals for Returning Visitors:

  - Easily locate social media links.
  - Understand the presented information.
  - Engage with the language learning content without difficulty.
    
### Planning Phase

To ensure a systematic approach to project management, I structured the development process into three distinct phases:

#### Phase 1: Conceptualisation

- Come up with ideas for 3 different language learning games that would be simple to program and easy to understand by users to facilitate language learning.
- Develop a brand theme, logo and colour scheme that would be attractive, facilitate learning, and encourage users to return.
- Design the site mobile-first and make sure it's properly responsive, be appropriately styled for and facilitates learning on, all devices.

#### Phase 2: Refinement

- Test the games and make any appropriate adjustments necessary for the games to function as intended.
- Solicit feedback from peers to gauge usability and functionality.
- Address any identified bugs or issues to enhance user experience.

#### Phase 3: Validation and Finalisation

- Conduct thorough testing using tools like W3C to ensure compliance with web standards.
- Prepare the project for submission, ensuring all requirements are appropriately met.

### Development Phase

During the development phase of this project, careful attention was given to crafting an immersive and visually appealing user experience:

#### Colour Scheme:

- Orange & Yellow
- White
- Midnight Purple
- Navy Blue

With a focus on user comfort, the design was carefully crafted to accommodate learning, with a simple plain background and a centered game area that focuses the user's attention to that space. Opting for a light background reduces distraction, while the purple is an attractive and positive colour that will encourage and direct the users focus. The colour palette was thoughtfully curated to deliver a cohesive and visually stimulating encounter, that will hopefully assist in facilitating user learning experiences.

#### Typography:

- Raleway
- Sans-Serif

Consistency in typography plays a pivotal role in maintaining readability and visual consistency throughout the site. Therefore, a deliberate choice was made to utilise a select combination of two fonts across all pages. Varied font weights, styles and colours were strategically incorporated to infuse visual interest while upholding a polished and professional appearance, with hopes that this will ensure the site narrative flows well and makes sense.

### Blueprint

During the development phase, detailed sketches were created to outline the project's design and functionality across various screen sizes and devices.

[Portfolio Wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-wireframes.webp)

These wireframes served as a first-draft blueprint for page layouts and responsiveness. Iterative adjustments were made during development to enhance user experience and resolve usability challenges.

### Site Structure

Que Padrísimo's website structure was designed to provide a user-friendly navigation experience. The structure is organized into three distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose and presenting relevant information effectively. Below is an overview of the site structure:

#### 1. Header:
- There will be a consistent header at the top of all site pages. The design will be consistent across all pages, and contain the logo which will also link back to the home page, and three additional links.
- These links will navigate the user to each page of the site, the home page, scramble game, and vocab flashcard practice.

#### 2. Home Page/Quiz Game:

- The landing page offers a brief introduction to the website and also to the first game of the site, the Quiz.
- It serves as the entry point to the platform, providing visitors with a user-friendly, interactive game in which they can test their intermediate-level Spanish.

#### 3. Scramble Game:

- This page matches the homepage in theme, style and layout, in hopes that this will facilitate learning and user focus. It also presents the users with the second interactive and engaging learning game, the word scramble game.
- It includes an introductory paragraph explaining to users what to do and how to play the game.

#### 4. Flashcards Vocab Practice:

- The last page also matches the homepage in theme, style and layout. Users are presented with 50 flashcards in which they can read a word in English and click the flashcard in order to reveal the Spanish word and pronunciation.
- It also includes instructional paragraphs both introducing the game and informing the users to click the flashcard to reveal the answer.

#### 5. Footer:

- Every page in the portfolio includes a consistently styled footer, that matches the header in colour, with social network icons and other relevant information presented.
- It serves as a reliable starting point for visitors to explore the website and contact me on other platforms should the need arise.

The site structure is ultimately designed to be visually appealing, logically organised, and simple to use, ensuring that visitors who browse Que Padrísimo with hopes of improving their Latin-Spanish language skills, have a pleasant and fascinating experience.

### Features Present:

- Responsive navbar facilitating easy navigation.

- Footer housing navigation links and social media icons.
![Footer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-footer.webp)
- An attractive Game Area.that focuses users' attention with hopes of facilitating learning and focusing attention.
![Game Area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-game-area.webp)
- The first game of the site, the Quiz. Users are presented with a 'start game button', then a question and 4 multiple-choice answers. When they guess correctly they are appropriately informed, as if they guess incorrectly. Once the quiz is complete users are presented with their final score and the option to play again or quit the quiz and return.
![Quiz Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-quiz.webp)
- The second game of the site, the Word Scramble. Users are presented with a 'start game button', then a scrambled Spanish word and a clue in English, and a 'quit game' and 'guess' button respectively. They may type their answer and make their guess, and their attempts and scores are recorded and presented.
![Word Scramble Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-scramble.webp)
- The last game of the site, the Flashcards, vocab practice. Users are presented with a flashcard and it's English word on the front. There are arrows for navigating between flashcards and a random button which will reveal a random flashcard. Once ready they may click the flashcard to reveal the Spanish word and its phonetical pronunciation.

![Flashcards Practice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/que-padrisimo-flashcard-two.webp)

### Features to Implement:

- One thing I tried to implement in this project but was not able to successfully execute it, was: I tried to move the long arrays of Spanish answers and questions to their own individual .json files, and 'fetch' the information from there in each .js file where appropriate. However after much testing I was unsuccessful in getting this to work - however, it does give me something to work on for next time, and also, at least I am aware of why this would be the preferred methodology, in keeping with good JavaScript practices.
- I would like one day to make a contact page with a functional contact form with email notification capabilities.
- Potentially the incorporation of and use of dynamic educational resources such as gifs and videos.
- A toggleable light/dark mode facility, allowing user browsing based on preferences.
- To create a distinct URL and domain to enhance branding efforts.
- A wider variety of games and learning tools. Expanded databases of questions and answers for the existing games as well as more features like countdown timers and the ability to create a profile and record scores and track progress.
- I would like to add rounds to the Word Scramble game so player would not repeat the words and be able to track their scores and progress better.
- The 404 page is not 'live' as this requires the site to be 'hosted' on a server - if the site was to be hosted on a server this page could be deployed for whenever a user tries to open a page that doesn't exist or use a broken link etc.

## Resolved and Unsolved Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

Several issues were identified and rectified during the Que Padrísimo website construction process to ensure optimal operation and user experience.

- Initially, when clicked, the navbar links were displaying behind the body, causing them to be obscured partially or entirely hidden from view and be unusable. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the solution was simple. To fix this issue, I adjusted the z-index properties of the header element to ensure that it remains presented above the body content and remains visible and useable at all times. [Nav bar bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/nav-bar-bug-before.webp) - [Nav bar bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/nav-bar-bug-after.webp)

- An issue arose with regards to the start button on the home page, for the 'Quiz' game. The button remained unstyled despite my adding the appropriate CSS styling rules and was not changing despite editing the CSS. After too much investigation I realised this was due to a simple typo in the HTML code for the class value of the button, after which I corrected and the issue was resolved.

- After adding the feature that a user can hit 'enter' to submit their score in the Word Scramble game, whenever I did so the score and attempts would increase by 2 - after investigation I realised this was because I had inadvertently added two handleEnterKeyPress functions to my JS. Removing one of the duplicate handleEnterKeyPress functions solved the issue and now the score is calculating correctly.

- A bug arose when testing the Flashcards game - despite the code seeming to function correctly, the 'words' being presented were always the same despite being able to scroll through the cards and the random button functioning as expected. After investigation, the reason for this was found to be an issue with my JavaScript. The solution was to add 'onclick="showNextCard()"' to the HTML, and once I did this the issue resolved itself satisfactorily. [Flashcard bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/flashcard-bug-before.webp) - [Flashcard bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/flashcard-bug-after.webp)

- Upon inspecting the footer section of the website, a perplexing issue surfaced where the four social media icons were appearing in the same position on the screen, making them unreadable and inaccessible. After much searching, I discovered a rogue 'position:fixed' in one of my CSS rules that was not supposed to be there. Once removed the social media icons displayed correctly as intended. [Footer bug before-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/footer-bug-before.webp) - [Footer bug after-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/footer-bug-after.webp)

### Unresolved Bugs

- There is one remaining issue with the Word Scramble game, in which, when a user clicks 'guess' and submits their answer, if they at that point hit 'enter', they are awarded an extra attempt and score if appropriate. This doubling of scores is one issue with the Java Script code that has not been resolved but should be feasible with some effort and attention.
- Some users reported an alignment issue with the 'Quit Quiz' and 'Play Again' buttons on the Quiz game. Despite testing on multiple devices and screen-resolutions I was not able to recreate the issue - the alignment seems fine on my devices. [Quiz Button bug - not able to reproduce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DamianGillessen1989/que-padrisimo/main/docs/quiz-buttons-bug.webp)
- On the word scramble game - when a player completes all the words in the list, they are then 'stuck' and are presented the last word from the array repeatedly until the page is refreshed. This is one thing that could be fixed with further development.
